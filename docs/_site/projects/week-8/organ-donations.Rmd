## Load and clean data

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(fixest)

organ_donations_raw <- read_csv("data/organ_donations.csv")
```

```{r}
# TODO: Make a dataset based on `organ_donations` that only contains California and New Jersey
# TODO: Make a new column called `After` that is TRUE (or 1) if the quarter is Q32011, Q42011, or Q12012 (or if Quarter_num is 4, 5, or 6)
# TODO: Make a new column called `is_california` that is TRUE (or 1) if the state is California
```


## Simple diff-in-diff

```{r}
# TODO: Using the data for only California and New Jersey, create a plot that shows
# the donation rate over time, colored by state. Add a vertical line at Q22011 (or Quarter_num = 3).
# Determine if the two states' trends are parallel before the change.
```

```{r}
# TODO: Use group_by() and summarize() to find the average donation rate in
# California and New Jersey before and after the change in California's policy
```

```{r}
# TODO: Use lm() to calculate the diff-in-diff effect with this model:
```

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Donation rate}\ =&\ \beta_0 + \beta_1\ \text{California} + \beta_2\ \text{After Q22011}\ + \\
&\ \beta_3\ (\text{California} \times \text{After Q22011})
\end{aligned}
$$


## Two-way fixed effects

```{r}
# TODO: Create a new dataset based on `organ_donations_raw` 
# TODO: Make a new column called `After` that is TRUE (or 1) if the quarter is Q32011, Q42011, or Q12012 (or if Quarter_num is 4, 5, or 6)
# TODO: Make a new column called `Treated` that is TRUE (or 1) if the state is California and After is TRUE/1
```

```{r}
# TODO: Use that new data to create a TWFE model like this:
```

$$
\text{Donation rate}\ =\ \beta_0 + \beta_1\ \text{Treatment} + \beta_2\ \text{State} + \beta_3\ \text{After}
$$
