Teachers in North Carolina Public schools earn a bonus of \$750 if the students in their school meet a standard called "expected growth." A summary statistic called "average growth" is computed for each school; the expected growth standard is met when this summary measure exceeds zero. (This is based on [actual econometric research](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/performanceincentives/files/2012/10/200803_Vigdor_TeacherBonusesNC.pdf).)

For this example, we'll use regression discontinuity techniques to see if failing to receive a bonus motivates teachers to improve their performance in the subsequent school year.

- Running variable = `avgrow05`
- Treatment = `expgrow`
- Outcome = `avgrow06`

```{r setup, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(haven)
library(broom)
library(rdrobust)
library(rddensity)
library(modelsummary)

schools <- read_stata("data/nc_schools.dta")
```

# Step 1: Rule based?

Yep.

# Step 2: Fuzzy or sharp?

# Step 3: Check for discontinuity in running variable around cutpoint

# Step 4: Check for discontinuity in outcome across running variable

# Step 5: Measure the size of the effect

## Parametric estimation

## Nonparametric estimation

# Step 6: Compare all the effects
