## R Markdown

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) file (it has a .Rmd file extension). When you execute code within the file, the results appear beneath the code. 

R code goes in **code chunks**, denoted by three backticks. Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button (a small green triangle) within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter* (or *Cmd+Shift+Enter* on Mac). 

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy), alpha = 0.2)
```

## Add a new code chunk

Add a new code chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd/Ctrl+Option+I*. 

Put 2 + 2 in your new code chunk and run it.

## Knitting R Markdown files

We'll use R Markdown files as notebooks as we learn because we can record text, code and output. 

R Markdown files are also a publication format. Try hitting the "Knit" button in the toolbar above. R runs all the code in the document from top to bottom, it collects the output and puts the code, text and output together in an HTML document---you should see it as `01-getting-started.html` in the Files pane. This document is a great way to record or share your work (you can also Knit to PDF or Word documents).

## Assigning variables

What's the difference between the code in this chunk:

```{r}
filter(mtcars, cyl == 4)
```

And the code in this chunk?

```{r}
four_cyls <- filter(mtcars, cyl == 4)
```

## Functions

Look at the help page for `seq`

Add a chunk here that uses `seq()` to create a list of numbers from 5 to 100, spaced by 5 (so 5, 10, 15, 20, etc.)

## Syntax gone wrong

```{r, error=TRUE}
sd(pull(.data = starwars, var = mass)
```

```{r, error=TRUE}
my_name <- "Andrew'
```

```{r, error=TRUE}
pull(.data = "starwars", var = height)
```
