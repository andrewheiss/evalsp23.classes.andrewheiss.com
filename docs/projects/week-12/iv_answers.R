# 3. Exogeneity
# Tell a story that distance to college isnâ€™t correlated with anything else in the model

# IN THEORY, living closer to a college should explain or increase the likelihood of attending college, but shouldn't in turn influence outcomes as an adult, like the propensity to vote.

# But in real life, that's not the case! Black and Hispanic Americans are more likely to live in urban areas, and there are more colleges in urban areas, and race/ethnicity are correlated with voting patterns
