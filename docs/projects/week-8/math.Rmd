```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(scales)  # For things like percent()

results <- read_csv("data/math_survey.csv") %>% 
  mutate(anxious_num = recode(math_anxiety, Yes = 1, No = 0)) %>% 
  mutate(treatment = fct_relevel(treatment, "Normal story"))
```


# Difference-in-differences by hand

```{r}
group_props <- results %>% 
  drop_na(math_anxiety) %>% 
  group_by(wave, treatment, math_anxiety) %>% 
  summarize(num = n()) %>% 
  group_by(wave, treatment) %>% 
  mutate(total = sum(num),
         prop_math_anxious = num / total) %>% 
  filter(math_anxiety == "Yes")
group_props
```

We care about the difference in the differences:

$$
(\text{After} - \text{before})_{\text{treatment}} - (\text{After} - \text{before})_{\text{control}}
$$

```{r}
after_treatment <- group_props %>% 
  filter(treatment == "Math story", wave == 2) %>% 
  pull(prop_math_anxious)

# TODO: Calculate these other values and make a table with cells for A, B, C,
# and D; then calculate the difference in differences

# before_treatment
# after_control
# before_control
```

```{r}
dd_effect <- (after_treatment - before_treatment) - (after_control - before_control)
dd_effect
```


# Difference-in-differences with regression

```{r}
# TODO: Calculate the same effect using regression instead of a 2x2 matrix
```


# Plot

```{r}
ggplot(group_props, aes(x = as.factor(wave), 
                        y = prop_math_anxious, 
                        color = treatment)) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = treatment)) #+
  # annotate(geom = "segment", x = "1", xend = "2", 
  #          y = before_treatment, yend = after_treatment - dd_effect,
  #          linetype = "dashed", color = "grey50") +
  # annotate(geom = "segment", x = "2", xend = "2",
  #          y = after_treatment, yend = after_treatment - dd_effect,
  #          linetype = "dotted", color = "blue") +
  # annotate(geom = "label", x = "2", y = 0.42, label = "Program effect",
  #          size = 3)
```
